    !!! warning "Known Issues"

        When using this feature, the number of running instances will not be shown.

#### Startup Arguments

:   Adds specific instructions as if Blender were launching from the command line (after the blender executable i.e. `blender [args …]`).

:   For example, the `-W` (force opening Blender in fullscreen mode) argument internally will produce the following command:

    ```
    %path to blender executable% -W
    ```

:   List of commands can be found on Blender manual [Command Line Arguments](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/command_line/arguments.html) page.

#### Bash Arguments

!!! info
    This only works on Windows.

:   Adds specific instructions as if Blender were launching from the command line (before the blender executable i.e. `[args …] blender`).

:   For example, `env __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia` (force Blender to use a dedicated graphics card) arguments internally will produce the following command:

    ```
    env __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia nohup %path to blender executable% %startup arguments%
    ```
```
