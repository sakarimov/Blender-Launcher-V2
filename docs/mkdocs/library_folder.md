# Library Folder

**Library Folder** - a directory on hard drive where all downloaded builds are stored.

!!! warning

    Don't create **Library Folder** inside UAC protected folders like `Program Files`. It is recommended to create a new directory on a non system drive or inside user folder like `Documents` to avoid any file collisions and have a nice structure.

## Changing Library Folder

On first launch Blender Launcher will ask for choosing **Library Folder**. After it can be changed in [Library Folder](settings.md#library-folder) section of [Settings Window](settings.md).

There is known issue related to Qt and some Linux distributions like Mint where it fails to show folder browser dialog window. To pass this issue it is possible to set **Library Folder** via command line arguments:

=== "Linux"

    ```
    ./Blender\ Launcher -set-library-folder "%PATH%"
    ```

=== "Windows CMD"

    ```
    "Blender Launcher.exe" -set-library-folder "%PATH%"
    ```

## Structure

**Library Folder** has the following structure:

```
.
└─ %Library Folder%
    ├─ bl_symlink
    ├─ .temp
    ├─ custom
    ├─ daily
    ├─ experimental
    ├─ stable
    └─ template
```

### `bl_symlink`

:   **bl_symlink** is a symbolic link that creates via [library build context menu](user_interface.md#library-build-context-menu).

### `.temp`

:   **.temp** folder is used to store downloaded `*.zip` and `*.tar` files.

### `custom`

:   **custom** folder is used to store builds downloaded by user manually (e.g. from [GraphicAll](https://blender.community/c/graphicall/)). To use custom builds with Blender Launcher they must be placed inside **custom** folder manually:

    ```
    .
    └─ %Library Folder%
        └─ custom
            ├─ %custom blender build 1%
            │   ├─ ...
            │   ├─ blender.exe
            │   └─ ...
            ├─ %custom blender build 2%
            │   ├─ ...
            │   ├─ blender.exe
            │   └─ ...
            └─ ...
    ```

### `daily`

:   **daily** folder is used to store [daily builds](https://builder.blender.org/download/daily/).

### `experimental`

:   **experimental** folder is used to store [experimental branches builds](https://builder.blender.org/download/experimental/).

### `stable`

:   **stable** folder is used to store [stable builds](https://download.blender.org/release/).

### `template`

:   **template** folder is used to store custom Blender preferences and scripts (e.g. [HEAVYPOLY config](https://github.com/HEAVYPOLY/HEAVYPOLY_Blender)). Template represents a file structure similar to one existing in Blender build (e.g. `blender-2.91.0-windows64\2.91`):

    ```
    .
    └─ %Library Folder%
        └─ template
            ├─ ...
            ├─ config
            ├─ datafiles
            ├─ scripts
            │   ├─ ...
            │   ├─ addons
            │   ├─ startup
            │   └─ ...
            └─...
    ```
